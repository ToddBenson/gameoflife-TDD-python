This project began as an exercise on codewars.com. It is based off of Conway's Game of Life.

The program starts with a given patern, in artray form, and the number of generations. The output is the pattern after the number
of generations.

It is being used by me to learn IntelliJ, and test driven development. Additional, I will be attempting it in Python, Java, and 
Scala. Maybe Javascript.
